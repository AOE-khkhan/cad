# ERGO: Algorithmic Designs

3D Printable Designs using Clojure and OpenSCAD

## Installation

Download from https://github.com/pkobrien/cad.

## Usage

Modify as you desire. You will need a working knowledge of Clojure, OpenSCAD
and my customized fork of scad-clj.

The Clojure code is meant to be run from a Clojure REPL. It creates scad source
files in the output directory. Each `.scad` file can then be opened in OpenSCAD
and exported as an STL file.

While not necessary, all the `.stl` files are included in this Git repository
because GitHub has a nice STL file viewer that lets you see what the 3-D 
objects look like with just a web browser.
